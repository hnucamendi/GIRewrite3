# HARD:

Create either a class or a function with clousres called `patientInformation`. It should contain at least two properties `name` and `ssn`. The `name` property does not need to be private and can be fetched directly, but the `ssn` property should only be manipulated through the use of `getters` you should not be able to get the value of ssn directly from where it is defined.

```JavaScript
console.log(patient2.names); // Output: Undefined
console.log(patient2.ssn); // Output: Undefined
console.log(patient2.getName()); // Output: John
console.log(patient2.getSSN()); // Output: 123-45-6789
```
