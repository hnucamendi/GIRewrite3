# EASY

Problem: A local gym wants to implement an "exercise of the day" program where there is a free class that day that promotes a certain exercise. The gym needs some backend logic that will update their system to reflect which exercise will be promoted that day. Write a function that will take as an input the name of an exercise and console log a message like `Today's exercise: running`

Note: you should only write one function that can dynamically print the value of the exercise for that day, and it must be a closure

```JavaScript
console.log(exercise("Running")()); // Output: Today's exercise: Running
console.log(exercise("Swimming")()); // Output: Today's exercise: Swimming
console.log(exercise("Dancing")()); // Output: Today's exercise: Dancing
console.log(exercise("Fencing")()); // Output: Today's exercise: Fencing
```
