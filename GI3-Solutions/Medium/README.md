# MEDIUM:

Suppose an array of numbers with a random order of numbers unknown to you beforehand. You are given a target value to search for. If found in the array return its `index`, otherwise return `-1`. You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Example 1:

```JavaScript
const findTarget = function(array, target) {...}

findTarget( [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], 0) // Output: 4
```

Example 2:

```JavaScript
const findTarget = function(array, target) {...}

findTarget([4,5,6,7,0,1,2], 3) // Output: -1
```
