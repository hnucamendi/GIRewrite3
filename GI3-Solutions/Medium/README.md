# MEDIUM:

Write a function that will allow you to calculate how many slices of pizza `x` each person `y` would get if they shared evenly. The function should return an interpolated string like `Each person gets 4.00 slices of pizza; from our 8 slice pizza` `x` being a decimal incase there is no way to split the pizza evenly.

Note: you should only write one function that can dynamically print the value of the exercise for that day, and it must be a closure

Example:

```JavaScript
console.log(sharePizza(8)(2)); // Output: Each person gets 4 slices of pizza; from our 8 slice pizza
console.log(sharePizza(8)(3)); // Output: Each person gets 2.67 slices of pizza; from our 8 slice pizza
console.log(sharePizza(21)(20)); // Output: Each person gets 1.05 slices of pizza; from our 21 slice pizza
console.log(sharePizza(10)(3)); // Output:Each person gets 3.33 slices of pizza; from our 10 slice pizza
```
